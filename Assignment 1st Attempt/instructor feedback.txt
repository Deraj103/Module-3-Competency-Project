Hi Jared, The inventory class should only declare variables for ID, name, price and quantity. (purchaseCost and totalCost are not needed.) 
It has only one method, purchase. The purchase method is passed the quantity and "returns" a double for the cost of that purchase. Therefore, 
the user input for "How many do you want?" is coded in Main. ---------------- In the Main method, use a loop to go through all 4 purchasers. 
Note this requires use of a temporary object to be able to re-use the code. The temp object should be type "object" so it can hold either a 
Customer or Employee object. (ie. object temp = cust1). (See attached code snippet). If the purchaser IS an employee apply the 25% discount to the total.
